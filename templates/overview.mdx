## Templates in Tenzo

Part of the flexibility of Tenzo comes from the ability to create organization-wide templates and rules that Tenzo's AI recruiting agents can follow.
Defining a template allows you to re-use a set of instructions accross a variety of jobs.

The following templates are available for management within the **Admin > Templates Bank** page.

- **[Question Bank](/templates/question-bank)** A set of pre-made commonly used questions and customized grading instructions which may be added to any job
- **[Background Info](/templates/background-info)** Background information about your organization for the AI recruiter to reference when answering candidate questions
- **[Script Generation Templates](/templates/script-generation)** Custom instructions to standardize interview script generation
- **[Summary Templates](/templates/summary-templates)** Standardize format for summary data collected after an interview
- **<u>Thank-You Email Templates</u>** Standardize the thank you email sent to a candidate after a video interview
