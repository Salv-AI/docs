## Script Generation Templates

Script Generation Templates allow you to customize how Tenzo's AI generates interview scripts for your recruiters.

Script generation may triggered from the dashboard when creating a new role, re-run to re-generate for an existing role, or, most commonly 
during an ATS sync if the rules are configured for "Script Generation" (instead of a fully pre-configured interview template).

Providing additional guidelines for the AI during generation can help ensure that the initially generated interviews are as close as possible to what a recruiter would have created manually.

You can provide instructions for:
- How to structure the call intro and outro
- An intended order, length, and flow of the screening questions
- Preferred question types and grading instructions guidelines for the auto-generated questions

## Configuring Script Generation Templates

Your organization comes with a blank **Default** script generation template. 
This template is automatically added to all jobs and provided as guidelines to the AI during the initial script generation.
Typically this template is used for standard script generation practices that will apply to all jobs 
and guidelines you'd like the AI to follow when creating interview scripts.

In addition to the default template, admins may create additional specific templates for specific sets of roles. 
For example, a customer may want different script styles or expect different common question types for technical roles versus customer-facing roles, and therefore create a template for each type.

## Rules Engine Implementation

To standardize the system of adding additional Script Generation Templates, most admins will create specific rules in the rules engine to add generation templates.

When a script generation templates are added as an action to relevant roles, the interview generation engine will follow the guidelines of all added generation templates
when generating an interview.
