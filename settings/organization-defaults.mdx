## Admin Settings Management

Admins may set a default or required configuration for any setting in the organization. These policies may be configured in the **Admin** page under the **Interview Settings** tab.

### Required vs Default Settings

Most settings may be set to either **Required** or **Default** wihtin the admin configuation page.

- **Required** settings cannot be modified on a per-interview basis. All interviews will receive the exact configuation of this setting.
- **Default** settings will be automatically set for all jobs in your organization. Default settings may be modified on a per-interview basis by users with *edit* permissions


### Examples
- If an admin sets a custom *AI Interview Name* to *Michelle* and marks the setting as **Required**, all active and future jobs will use *Michelle* as the interviewer name
- If an admin sets the schedule follow up setting to **Disabled** and marks the setting as **Required**, the schedule follow-up setting will disabled for all interviews. 
Recruiters will **not** be able to toggle this setting on for any jobs while the setting is **Disabled** and **Required**.
- If an admin sets the *Outreach Emails* setting to **Disabled** but **Optional**, then recruiters with edit permissions will be able to enable this setting for any interview


### Best Practices

- It is recommended to leave most settings as optional to allow recruiters flexibility to cusotmize settings on a per-job basis. 

- However, we still recommend setting preferred defaults for any applicable optional setting so all new interviews automatically follow the preferred default behavior

- **Required** settings are typically reserved for policies which your company wants to ensure are always enforced. For example, enforcing compliant outreach hours or using a consistent caller name are common *required* settings.
