## Overview
An Organization Admin may specifify rules that apply to all sourcing sessions to ensure recruiter compliance with organization rules and best practices.

Filters may be defined on ATS candidate fields to only permit sourcing candidates under certain conditions.


## Setting up Custom Rules of Engagement

In the example below, a rule is defined to exclude candidates from forbidden categories as defined in the bullhorn ATS.

Once this rule is created, candidates from these forbidden categories will not be included in future sourcing session results.

Some fields are included by default for each ATS.
Additional fields for a specific ATS integration can be integrated and mapped per customer request as needed to facilitate the creation of additional rules.
