## ATS Integrations

Tenzo integrates with all of the top applicant tracking systems in recruting and staffing.
Integration setup and configuration can be managed via the **Admin** settings portal.

The lifecycle of a linked ATS interview is as follows

1. **Job Sync** Every 5 minutes, Tenzo will sync any new or updated jobs into the Tenzo platform. Interviews will be configured based on Organizaiton Defaults Settings and any matching Rules Engine conditions.
2. **Applicant Sync** When an applicant applies to a linked job, Tenzo will sync the applicant into the platform.
3. **Outreach and Interview** If an applicant is in a valid stage or status (configurable in the ATS Settings page) Tenzo will engage the candidate and conduct the configured interview, saving all results as viewable in the Tenzo platform.
4. **Post-Interview ATS Actions** Once the interview is complete, all interview results will posted back to the ATS. 
Custom follow up actions dependent on the interview results (status update, stage movement), and the propogation of additional custom extracted information to the ATS may also be configured.
