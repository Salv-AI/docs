## Settings Management in Tenzo

Much of the power of the Tenzo platform is the potential for customization and automation of settings management in your organization.

Recruiters with edit permissions can configure settings for specific jobs, but organization admins can set rules, restrictions, and defaults for any setting which can apply all jobs or only a specific set of jobs.


Inteview settings can be modified in 3 primary ares of the platform
- On a specific job's **Configure** page under **Settings**
- In the **Admin** tab under **Interview Settings** for global settings defaults
- In the **Admin** tab via the **ATS Rules Engine** for settings which should apply only to a specific set of jobs
