## Question Bank Templates

The Question Bank allows you to create and manage a library of pre-made questions with customized grading instructions that can be added to any job.

### Adding Questions to the Question Bank

Questions can be created directly in the question bank, or added to the question bank from a job's configuration page.

<Frame caption="Job > Configure > Screening Questions > Save to Question Bank">

</Frame>



### Using Question Bank Templates

Saved may then be added directly to a job from the interview configuration page, saving editors time copying over the desired settings and grading instructions from previous interviews.

When a question is added from the bank to a job, it is "copied" - meaning that the recruiter can then modify the question without modifying the original question from the Question Bank.
