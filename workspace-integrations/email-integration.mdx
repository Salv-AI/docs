## Email Integration Uses

Once your email has been connected, candidates can communicate with Morgan over email to schedule interviews and ask questions about the role.

The email integration may be used for both video and phone interviews.

**Video Interviews**
When connected, your custom recruiting domain will be used to send candidates interview links. 
If not connected, candidates will still receive emails with links to the video interview from the 'tenzo.ai' domain, but connecting a custom email 
is preferred by most customers to ensure consistent branding for candidate communication.

**Phone Screens**
If a candidate does not answer the initial phone call, Morgan may be configured to reach out again over SMS and email to schedule a call and perform the initial screen.
If you have connected a designated recruiting email domain, Morgan will not only reach out over SMS but will also email candidates to attempt to schedule a phone interview.


## Link A Recruiting Email

To link your email, navigate to the **Admin > Office Integrations > Email Integrations** page.

First, follow the steps on the page to grant Tenzo's email integration access to your organization's directory.

Once that is complete, designate a specific **Recruiting Outreach Email** from your domain that will be used for communication with candidates.

## Customize Email Outreach for Phone Interviews

The initial outreach email sent to candidates may be customized for any role in the **Initial Email** step. 
Email outreach may also be enabled or disabled for any role in this step.
