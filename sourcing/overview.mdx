## Sourcing in Tenzo

Once enabled for your organization, Tenzo offers the ability to automatically match candidates from your ATS database to an active role.

Tenzo's AI agent will automatically generate requirements based on the job description and find an initial set of matching candidates 
based on prior experience in the candidate resumes.

These requirements as well as additional filters may be adjusted to narrow the search. Custom fields from candidates in your ATS may be added to further constrain the search.

Tenzo's agent grows more powerful over time. Information from prior calls is extracted and indexed directly in the sourcing

## Souring Basics

Once the candidates in your ATS have been indexed, for any role you may navigate to the **Sourcing** tab. 
The AI sourcing agent will generate an initial set of requirements based on the job description candidates for you to review.

Any requirement can be modified or removed. In the redacted example above, experince with *Live Tooling* and *Setup* were marked as required for this CNC Role,
while skills like *leadership* were marked nice-to-have, meaning they will not affect the results as strongly.

In addition to high level requirements, recruiters may modify additional filters such as **distance from the job** or years of work experience to further filter results.

Additional filters based on fields from the ATS may be configured in the **Rules of Engagement** page.

Once enough filters are adjusted, candidates may be added to the job either one at a time or in *bulk*. 
Once added to an active job, sourced candidates will be run through the phone screen and results will be posted to the ATS just like applicants.


## Initial Setup

To enable sourcing, Tenzo's support team must first initiate a one-time-job to index candidates from your ATS to be discoverable by the sourcing engine. 
Once this is complete, new candidates or updates to existing candidates will sync automatically and the souring engine is ready to use.
