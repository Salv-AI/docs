## Calendar Integration Feature

You can connect your Microsoft or Google calendar directories to automatically schedule follow-ups with candidates who pass the AI interview.
These follow-up events may be customized with Teams, Meet, or Zoom interview links and custom event bodies. 

## Linking your Calendar Directory

To enable the **Follow Up Interviews** feature, which will automatically schedule a follow-up interview with candidates who pass the screen, you must first enable access to your organization's calendar directory.
The calendar can be connected under **Admin > Office Integrations >  Calendar Integration** by a user in your organization with Google or Microsoft workspace admin permissions.

Once the calendar integration is complete, you can then assign follow up users to jobs, or simply have a recruiter automatically selected from the hiring team linked to the job in your ATS.




## Enabling Automatic Follow Up Interviews

You may then turn on the *Schedule Follow Up* feature for any job in the *Outro and Scheduling* step of the configure page.

When you toggle on the *Schedule Follow-Up Interviews* setting, for all candidates who score above the passing score, Morgan will propose times from the configured User's calendar and then schedule the follow up interview.

You may then customize the following for any job:
- Total number of follow up interviews scheduled per job (once over the total, Morgan will simply elegantly end future interviews by saying she will be in touch)
- Passing score threshold (if the candidate scores below the passing score, Morgan will simply elegantly end the interview and say she will be in touch)
- Add a video meeting link (eg. Teams / Google Meet / Zoom)
- The meeting duration
- The meeting event description


Default values for these settings may also be configured on an organization level by the Admin.

## Automating Follow-up Recruiters from ATS

If your job was synced from an ATS, and you have the schedule follow up setting **enabled** in your organization default settings, 
then one of the recruiters from your ATS will be automatically assigned to the job as the designated follow up user.


If you haven't selected a specific calendar in your Rules Engine configuration, then one of the recruiters will be auto-assigned from the linked ATS position.
